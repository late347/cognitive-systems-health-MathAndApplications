# cognitive-systems-health-MathAndApplications

Python (anaconda) exercises in Machine Learning in cognitive systems mathematics and methods course.

Note! for exercise 6 recommender systems the datasets two csv files were too large to upload to github, so it
possible that you can find the same anime.csv and rating.csv from the jupyternotebook file's link near the beginning.
the link will be to kaggle website possibly...

I learned a lot about Python, numpy, scikit-learn, and other machine learning related things during this course, and I got good points from these lab assignments also!!!
