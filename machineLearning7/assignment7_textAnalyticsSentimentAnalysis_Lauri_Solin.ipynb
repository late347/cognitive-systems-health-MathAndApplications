    "3. then we can get fast performance hopefully for column operations\n",
    "4. we can add a rowCount column so that we get 1-based indexing helper column\n",
    "5. we should be able to apply functions into the strings, which are in the rowString column (I will make it when load csv)\n",
    "6. we should be able to get quick counts into a helper column for the sum(poswords-negwords) quite easily\n",
    "7. we should make positibe words and negative words into python dictionaries, such that we get good performance boost when we search into them (we will have to make lookups into the dicts, to find if the word is positive or negative or neither of them => implies neutral)\n",
    "8. search each row for each word check if you find it in either of the two dictionaries, if not found it was neutral\n",
